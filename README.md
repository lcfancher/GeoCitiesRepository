# GeoCities Repository
## A prototype digital repository to preserve various GeoCities webpages.

Sourced from OoCities.Org, this set of 5 sites represents a prototype repository for GeoCities sites.\

Currently, to view a site, navigate to [https://download-directory.github.io/](https://download-directory.github.io/), and enter the URL of a digital object (for example, [https://github.com/lcfancher/GeoCitiesRepository/tree/main/GeoCitiesHTMLFiles/Beverly%20Hills%2090210](https://github.com/lcfancher/GeoCitiesRepository/tree/main/GeoCitiesHTMLFiles/Beverly%20Hills%2090210)). After downloading the resulting .zip file, extract it and open the .html file with a web browser like Chrome or Edge.
